Online learning has become a valuable and practical resource for curriculum delivery globally as a consequence of safety precautions mandated by COVID-19. Numerous benefits of online learning have been documented in the literature for learners, including quick access to information, appropriate content distribution, content standardization, personalized training, self-pacing, interaction, and enhanced convenience. During the COVID-19 epidemic, online education enabled universities to keep their doors open to students during the lockdown, therefore reducing the spread of the virus. The purpose of this research was to determine the level of satisfaction with e-learning among local university students. This project contains the dataset acquired using a Google form, as well as the research article.
